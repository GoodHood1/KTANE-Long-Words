                <h2>On the Subject of Module Name</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">I bet you didn’t even know some of these words existed.</p>

                <p>On the module you are presented with an 6-letter word at the top, a 5 letter changeable section of a word in the middle and a 
                    screen at the bottom with the encrypted version of the top word.</p>

                <p>The goal of this module is to figure which section of which word was used as a key 
                    to get from the top display to the bottom display.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: Word Used</h3>

                <p>Firstly, we need to find out which word was used for the encryption.</p>
                <p>Use the following rules to find out which word was used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If there is more than 6 batteries, your word is <b>PNEUMONOULTRAMICROSCOPICSILICOVOLCANOCONIOSIS</b></li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are at least 2 empty port plates, your word is <b>PSEUDOPSEUDOHYPOPARATHYROIDISM</b></li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are at least 2 vowels in the serial number, your word is <b>FLOCCINAUCINIHILIPILIFICATION</b></li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the absolute difference between the number of lit and unlit indicators is at least 2, your word is <br><b>ANTIDISESTABLISHMENTARIANISM</b></li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there is a 2 in the serial number, your word is <b>HIPPOPOTOMONSTROSESQUIPPEDALIOPHOBIA</b></li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if none of the other conditions were met, your word is <b>SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS</b></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Step 2: Finding the key section</h3>

                <p>So now you have your keyword, a 5-letter part of this word was used to get from the top to the bottom word using a Playfair Cipher, 
                    where the key-section is placed at the start of the Playfair Cipher. You have to figure out which part of the word was used. 
                    This would be a tedious task, so the module has taken pity on this grueling task. 
                    Use the following rules to generate a range of positions which the first letter of five will fall into. 
                    (Of course, this may not narrow down the options if the start and the end of the word end up being the range.) 
                    If the number is negative, take its absolute value. 
                    If either number from this calculation is greater than the amount of letters in your word, 
                    take the number modulo the amount of letters in your word, and then add 1.
